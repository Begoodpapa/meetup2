					<h4>Overview of the project</h4>					
					<h6><li>Chronology: Dec 2015 to Dec 2017</li></h6>
					<h6><li>Geographical Location: Hangzhou, China</li></h6>
					<h6><li>Name of Organization: R&D Centre, Nokia Solutions and Networks</li></h6>
					<h6><li>Position Occupied: Test Engineer & Software Engineer</li></h6>
					</p>
					<p>Beehive a Sails based web application. It is used inside NOKIA for public group and event. Group is an abstract concept used to organize relevant events. The event can be one contest, workshop or training.... It is the bridge between event organizer and other people. People can join the interested group and event with his own needs. Previously the communication mainly relies on newsletter which is not so efficient.</p>
					<p>Now Beehive has been deployed in my personal website, you can visit it via: http://www.nzleo.net/beehive</p>
					<p>Followed by this project, we also have plan to develop one system called Persona which can show the competence level of our employee, further we will build another system called WeBond on which our employee can exchange knowledge. Beehive project is the base for coming two system.</p>
					<p>All of these three systems will work together to help build strength community and software craftsmanship culture in the company.</p>
					<br>
					
					<h4>My role and responsibilities</h4>	
					<p>Beehive is part of a big ecosystem (called Ranking System), which consists by: </p>
					<li>Beehive</li>					
					<li>Persona<ul>A website to show the competence level of each one from different aspects, combining different data visualization view. The competence data partly comes from Beehive, user can also input data from other channels.</ul></li>
					<li>Webond<ul>A knowledge/experience/skill exchange website. People can post either their [Service] or  [Request], and the website will match the supply and demand then make the deal successfully.</ul></li>
					<li>Pigeon<ul>An Email service provider, it receives requests from whole ecosystem, and deliver mail notification to target persons.</ul></li>													
					<p>I work as both tester and developer for this ecosystem.</p>
					<h5>As Tester</h5>
					<p>
						I perform functional testing for Persona:
						<li>user profile management</li>
						<li>skill and skillset management</li>						
					</p>
					<p>
						I perform functional and non-functional testing for Pigeon:
						<li>email sending by personal id, mail address and group address</li>
						<li>capacity and performance</li>
						<li>stability</li>
					</p>	
					<p>
						I perform functional testing for Webond:
						<li>knowledge exchange</li>
						<li>user message box</li>
						<li>honorwall</li>
					</p>			
					<p>
						I perform integration testing for the whole ecosystem:
						<li>Employee Credit Points Obtaining</li>
						<li>Credit Pionts Redemption</li>
						<li>Ranking Table Generation According To Filters</li>
					</p>						
					<p>I automate all upper testing cases by Robot Framework and Selenium library. There are a lot of testing keyword written in Python. All automatic testing cases are integrated to Jenkins based Continuous Integration environment, which can verify each time of new code commit in very short time cycle.</p>
					<h5>As Developer</h5>
					<p>
						I am one of key developers of Beehive:
						<li>Take tasks of Front End(node.js, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap etc) and Back End(node.js) fucntionality for Group Management, Event Management and User Log In/Out. </li>
						<li>Transform the whole website framework to React.js</li>
						<li>Optimize data access perforce by using Redux technogoly</li>
						<li>Study and change deployment environment to Docker</li>
						<li>Use Mocha/Supertest/Chai to perform unit test</li>
						<li>Deploy latest product in production server</li>

					<code>readme.md</code> is the project introduction. 'bower.json' and 'package.json' define the needed packages which will be installed by
					'npm -i' and 'bower -i' commands.</li>
					<li>folder <code>api/controllers</code> is the Controllers (the C in MVC). They are the principle objects in this project that are responsible for responding to requests from a web browser. They act as a middleman between your models and views.
					The controllers will contain the bulk of project’s business logic.</li>
					<li>folder <code>api/models</code> is the M part in MVC. It defines the attributes of tables and records in database.</li>
					<li>folder 'assets' contains the static resouce used in this project, includes js, css and images files. Also the third part JS library is in this folder.</li>
					<li>folder 'node_modules' contains the packages used in this project.</li>
					<li>folder 'react' contains React framework based source code.</li>
					<li>folder 'config' contains the overall config info for the project. The most important file is connections.js, models.js and routes.js. Connections.js define which database will be used.
					And the models.js defines the database config info.  routes.js is one important file which define the url mapping way between url and the action in controllers.</li>
					<li>folder 'views' is the V part in MVC. It will be render and showed in web browser.</li>
					<li>folder 'images' under the root of project is used to save the pictures uploaded by users.</li>
