    <h2>About Beehive</h2>
    <h4>One pain in a big organization is communication and resource sharing. <a href="http://beehive.eecloud.dynamic.nsn-net.net/">Beehive</a> is developed to address this pain.</h4>
    <h4>The original idea behind Beehive is to create a bridge between employees, communities, virtual teams and different events. In our R&D center, we have many kind of events like contest, training, technical talk and workshop…But our employees still complain they have less information for such events, not to say join them. Meanwhile organizers feel difficult to attract enough people to join their events, sometimes they even feel de-motivated. One important reason for this is insufficient communication channels. Previously we can only rely on newsletters and posters, now we have one more channel - Beehive! Event owners can publish their events in Beehive for users to enroll, and users can get mail notifications when their favorite events are coming. Users can browse the information of past events, and these history data in Beehive can also be the input for further data analysis. For example, we can know who is the most active contributor on a specific topic. </h4>
    <h4>Beehive is a good example to use existed resources as much as possible. It is fully built on open source softwares: nodejs, sails, xheditor, jcrop, jquery, D3, bootstrap, react, dropzone, pickmeup…. Beehive is also one good example of cross cooperation, more than 20 people from different BLs have joined this project, and more than 10 people have given contributions to this production. If someone complain it is not good enough, we can make it better because it is internal open source, even users can contribute. </h4>
    <h4>If you have interest in internal open source projects, or you are interested in Nodejs development, you are welcome to join us.</h4>
